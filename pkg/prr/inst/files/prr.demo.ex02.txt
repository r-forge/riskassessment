# The first item is the description of the chain
<<chain 1>>
((defi)) This chain is just a very basic example. 
         A mixture of two Normal variable was
         chosen for this.
((role)) To give some insight about the mechanisms involved.
((comm)) It comprises four variables : p, X1, X2 and XX.
         "p" is the degree of adherence to population "X1"
         with respect to "X2". Extreme values are 0 (belongs
         entirely to "X2") and 1 (belongs entirely to "X1").
         "X1" is the value for population 1
         "X2" is the value for population 2
         "XX" is the value for the mixture,
         namely "XX = p*X1 + (1-p)*X2"
