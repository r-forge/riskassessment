=== fitdistrplus : Help to fit of a parametric distribution ===


Version 0.1-4
=============

NEW FEATURES
- a component named dots added to the list returned by fitdist and fitdistcens in order to pass optional arguments
for the control of optimization in mledist to bootdist and bootdistcens. bootdist and bootdistcens
changed to take into account these optional arguments if they are defined in the call to fitdist or fitdistcens.
- an argument added to fitdist, fitdistcens and mledist, named fix.arg, and giving the possibility to fix some
of the distribution parameters while maximizing the likelihood. Functions bootdist, bootdistcens and gofstat were also
changed in order to take this new argument into account.
- a new data file of bacterial contamination censored data extracted from Busschaert et al. 2000 and examples 
corresponding to analysis of this dataset. 

BUG FIXES

- correction of a bug in the print and the plot of boostraped samples using bootdist or bootdistcens
when there was only one parameter estimated by maximum likelihood.

Version 0.1-3
=============

NEW FEATURES
- new data file "groundbeef" (groundbeef.rda and groundbeef.Rd) and new use of this dataset in some examples.
- new function gofstat. 
    Goodness-of-fit statistics are no more computed by fitdist but may computed and printed
    by the use of the function gofstat. In this new function, the whole results computed are not printed :
    results of tests are printed only if the argument print.test==TRUE and for continuous distributions
    only Anderson-Darling and Kolomogorov-Smirnov statistics are printed by default (but complete results
    are returned by gofstat).
- modifications in descdist : three arguments were added in descdist
    1/ method, to choose between unbiased estimations
    of standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis (default choice) and 
    sample values.
    2/ obs.col to choose the color used to plot the observed point on the graph.
    3/ boot.col to choose the color used to plot the bootstrap sample of points on the graph.
- modifications in plotfit : minor changes were performed in order to facilitate the use of the argument ...
    to personnalize the plots (see examples in plotdist.Rd)
- modication of the vignette

BUG FIXES

- correction of a bug in plotdist due to the redefinition in the previous version
    of the parameter "ylim" for the plot of a histogram with theoretical density function 
    (there was a problem with infinite values of theoretical density function)

Version 0.1-2
=============

NEW FEATURES

- supression of mledistcens and modification of mledist in order
to maximize likelihood for both censored and non censored data.
- possibility to choose the optimization method used for maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) of distribution parameters using the new
argument "optim.method" of mledist.
- possibility to specify contraints on distribution parameters using 
the new arguments "lower" and "upper" of mledist.
- possibility to use a custom optimization function for MLE using the 
new argument "custom.optim".
- moment matching estimation is no longer done with argument method
set to "mom" but set to "mme" in fitdist.
- renaming of momdist in mmedist.
- calculation of AIC and BIC criterion after maximum likelihood 
estimation of distribution parameters
- change of the default number of iterations from 999 to 1001 
for boostrap in order to avoid interpolation using the quantile function
- use of the argument "log" and (resp. "log.p") of density (resp. 
distribution) when available to compute the loglikelihood.

BUG FIXES

- omitting the name of the first argument in calls to the density function
during maximization of the likelihood in order to enable the use of a density
function defined with a first parameter (the vector of quantiles) with a name
differing from "x" (classical name for density distributions defined in R), 
such as the density function dexGAUS from the package gamlss.dist.


Version 0.1-1
=============

- Initial release.
