=== fitdistrplus : Help to fit of a parametric distribution ===

Version 0.1-2
=============

NEW FEATURES

- supression of mledistcens and modification of mledist in order
to maximize likelihood for both censored and non censored data.
- possibility to choose the optimization method used for maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) of distribution parameters using the new
argument "optim.method" of mledist.
- possibility to specify contraints on distribution parameters using 
the new arguments "lower" and "upper" of mledist.
- possibility to use a custom optimization function for MLE using the 
new argument "custom.optim".
- moment matching estimation is no longer done with argument method
set to "mom" but set to "mme" in fitdist.
- renaming of momdist in mmedist.
- calculation of AIC and BIC criterion after maximum likelihood 
estimation of distribution parameters
- change of the default number of iterations from 999 to 1001 
for boostrap in order to avoid interpolation using the quantile function
- use of the argument "log" and (resp. "log.p") of density (resp. 
distribution) when available to compute the loglikelihood.

BUG FIXES

- omitting the name of the first argument in calls to the density function
during maximization of the likelihood in order to enable the use of a density
function defined with a first parameter (the vector of quantiles) with a name
differing from "x" (classical name for density distributions defined in R), 
such as the density function dexGAUS from the package gamlss.dist.
