\title{ Estimation of quantiles from a distribution fitted on censored data}

\description{
 Uses the fit of a distribution to censored data to estimate quantiles for given probabilities, 
 using non parametric bootstrap to calculate a 95 percent confidence interval for each estimated quantile (optional).  
}

\usage{
quantiledistcens(f, probs = seq(0.1,0.9,0.1), bootstrap = TRUE,
    CI.type = "two.sided",
    bootstrap.arg = list(niter=1001))
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.

\arguments{
\item{f}{An object of class 'fitdistcens', result of the function \code{fitdistcens}.}
\item{probs}{Numeric vector of probabilities with values in [0,1].}
\item{bootstrap}{If \code{TRUE}, bootstrap is performed to calculate quantile confidence intervals. }
\item{CI.type}{Type of confidence interval, \code{"two.sided"}, or one-sided \code{"less"}
     or \code{"greater"}}
\item{bootstrap.arg}{List of arguments to be passed to \code{\link{bootdistcens}}  }
}

\details{
    Quantiles of the parametric distribution are calculated for
    each probability specified in \code{probs}, using the estimated parameters given by the 'fitdistcens' result.
    If \code{bootstrap} is \code{TRUE}, a bootstrap procedure is then performed using \code{\link{bootdistcens}}
    on the 'fitdistcens' result, and quantiles of the parametric distribution are calculated for
    each probability specified in \code{probs}, using each set of boostrapped values of parameters.  
    If inferior to the whole number of bootstrap iterations, the number of iterations for which the estimation converges 
    is also printed in the summary.
    If \code{CI.type} is \code{two.sided},
    the 95 percent two-sided confidence intervals of quantiles (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles) are calculated.
    If \code{CI.type} is \code{less},
    the 95 percent one-sided confidence intervals of quantiles (95th percentiles) are calculated.
    If \code{CI.type} is \code{greater},
    the 95 percent one-sided confidence intervals of quantiles (5th percentiles) are calculated.

\value{ 
    \code{quantiledist} returns a list with 4 components,
    \item{ quantiles }{ a dataframe containing the estimated quantiles for each probability value specified in 
        the argument \code{probs} (one row, and as many columns as values in \code{probs}}
    \item{ resbootdistcens }{ the output of the function \code{\link{bootdistcens}} applied to \code{f} or NULL if 
        \code{bootstrap} is \code{FALSE}}
    \item{bootquant}{ a data frame containing the bootstraped values for each quantile
         (many rows, as specified in the call to \code{\link{bootdist}},
         and as many columns as values in \code{probs}, or NULL if 
        \code{bootstrap} is \code{FALSE} }
    \item{quantCI}{ by default bounds of the  95 percent two.sided confidence interval for each quantile 
        (two rows, the first one for the 2.5th percentile and the second one for the 97.5th percentile,
         and as many columns as values in \code{probs}), or NULL if 
        \code{bootstrap} is \code{FALSE}. If \code{CI.type} is \code{less}, right bound of the 95 percent
        one.sided confidence interval for each quantile (one row with 95th percentiles).
        If \code{CI.type} is \code{greater}, left bound of the 95 percent
        one.sided confidence interval for each quantile (one row with 5th percentiles). }
