 I finally decided to split the first version of /rbmn/ into three parts (i) a standalone part, (ii) a set of functions depending on published packages like /bnlearn/, /igraph/,... and (iii) the part depending on /rbsb/ unpublished packages.

 To do so, I have to duplicate into /rbmn/ some very basic function of /rbsb/ like "bc" under another name. To facilitate the evolution, the names prefixed with "r." like "r.bc".

 The code files are consisting with this hierarchy:

 ((level 1))

 rbsb    : duplication of /rbsb/ functions
 auxi    : private functions of /rbmn/, that is non intended for the final user
 normal  : specific functions for the multinormal distributions
 nbneq   : general functions for nbn objects (equivalence)
 nbnma   : general functions for nbn objects (manipulation)
 nbnmi   : general functions for nbn objects (miscellaneous)
 nbnst   : general functions for nbn objects (statistics)
 chain   : specific functions for chain nbn
 crossed : specific functions for nbn objects
 misc    : miscellaneous functions not pertinent for the previous categories

 ((level 2))

 interface : either translating /rbmn/ objects into other packet objects (and vice-versa)
             or proposing some actions depending on other packages (like a plot)

 ((level 3))

 more : all function depending too strongly on /rbsb/ to be introduced
        in the above levels.
