\subsection{Variability and uncertainty in the risk assessment framework }

According to international recommendations, a QRA should reflect the
{}``variability'' in the risk and calculate the {}``uncertainty''
associated with the risk estimate. The variability represents temporal,
geographical and/or individual heterogeneity of the risk for a given
population. The {}``uncertainty'' is understood as stemming from
a lack of perfect knowledge about the QRA model structure and associated
parameters%
\footnote{In the engineering risk community, these concepts are refered as \textquotedbl{}aleatoric
uncertainty\textquotedbl{} for \textquotedbl{}variability\textquotedbl{}
and \textquotedbl{}epistemic uncertainty\textquotedbl{} for \textquotedbl{}uncertainty\textquotedbl{}.%
}.

In order to estimate the natural {}``variability'' of the risk,
a Monte-Carlo simulation approach may be useful: the empirical distribution
of the risk within the population may be estimated from the mathematical
combination of distributions reflecting the variability of parameters
across the population.

A two-dimensional (or second-order) Monte-Carlo simulation was proposed
to estimate the {}``uncertainty'' in the risk estimates stemming
from parameter uncertainty. A two-dimensional Monte-Carlo simulation
is a Monte-Carlo simulation where the distributions reflecting \textquotedbl{}variability\textquotedbl{}
and the distributions representing \textquotedbl{}uncertainty\textquotedbl{}
are sampled separately in the simulation, so that \textquotedbl{}variability\textquotedbl{}
and \textquotedbl{}uncertainty\textquotedbl{} in the output may be
estinated separately.

Alternatively, you can distinguish between input and output code:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> library(mc2d)
R> ndvar(1001)
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{CodeOutput}
[1] 1001 
\end{CodeOutput}
\begin{CodeInput}
ndunc(1001)
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{CodeOutput}
[1] 1001 
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

Or

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
library(mc2d)
ndvar(1001)
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{CodeOutput}
[1] 1001 
\end{CodeOutput}
\begin{CodeInput}
ndunc(1001)
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{CodeOutput}
[1] 1001 
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}
