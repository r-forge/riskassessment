====== fitdistrplus: TODO list ======

(order/numbers mean nothing)

=== short term ===

1. Remove calls to options(digits) in the code
    done everywhere                                     

2. Change print.fitdist and print.fitdistcens in order to give an output ressembling to the one of fitdistr

3. put spaces before and after affectations (x <- 3) to make codes easier to read
    done in fitdist and mledist 

4. Remove echo in mledist before submission to CRAN 
   done

5. Change fitdistcens and mledistcens in the same way as fitdist and mledist 
   done by gathering mledist and mledistcens
   and adding new examples with optim.function or custom function for censored data)

6. Split summary.fitdist and print.summary.fitdist which is too long in two parts : 
   summary and gof (for goodness-of-fit results)

7. Change plotdist to use plot(ecdf...)

8. Try not to cut the density plot
   done

9. Draw the observed point in color in descdist

10. Add an argument in descdist not to plot the Cullen and Frey graph as in boxplot

11. Add a which argument to plotdist (be careful, only two plots are possible for
    discrete distributions or when there is only data in the arguments)

12. Split summary.fitdist in two parts : summary.fitdist and print.summary.fitdist
    done but to STILL TO DO for fitdistcens, bootdist and bootdistcens
    
13. Check the values in the data set for censored data to reject a left value greater than a right value

14. Add a part on how to change le algorithm used to maximize the likelihood in the vignette
    done


=== long term ===

1. Enable to enter complete names of distributions as in fitdistr

2. Examine how it is possible to replace plotdist by plot.fitdist 
(not so simple as plotdist was written also to plot an observed distribution,
but it could be be splitted in two parts)

3. Try to do only one fonction for bootstrap that could be called with on the output of fitdist or fitdistcens

5. Decide if it is possible and desirable to gather fitdist and fitdistcens
   for the moment we think it is not easy and not desirable

6. Add other gof graphs and stats for fits on censored data (Turnbull, ...).
Ask to JBD who seemed to have ideas

7. Improve moment matching estimation with numerical optimization

8. Start quantile matching estimation
