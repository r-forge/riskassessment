====== fitdistrplus: TODO list ======

(order/numbers mean nothing)

=== short term ===
30. if fixed arguments are used,  add the fixed argument values in the result.
32. Add argplot1, argplot2, argplot3 and argplot4  arguments for the four plots of plotdist
24. gather bootdist and bootdistcens
25. gather fitdist and fitdistcens, adding an output "cens" to facilitate the recognition of
    fits on censored data for plotting, gofstat ...
26. change the affectation and the use of argument discrete in order to be able to consider
    as dicrete other distributions than those defined in R (such as zero-inflated Poisson dist)
3. put spaces before and after affectations (x <- 3) to make codes easier to read
    done at least in fitdist and mledist 
12. Split summary.fitdist in two parts : summary.fitdist and print.summary.fitdist
    done for fitdist and fitdistcens but STILL TO DO for bootdist and bootdistcens
28. add an echo argument useful for debugging or when the optimization does not converge.
    
=== long term ===

19. Add other gof graphs and stats for fits on censored data (Turnbull, ...) and gof statistics for censored data
   computed from Turnbull CDF(partially done : Turnbull plot).

11. Add a which argument to plotdist (be careful, only two plots are possible for
    discrete distributions or when there is only data in the arguments, so not so easy)

15. Enable to enter complete names of distributions as in fitdistr

17. Try to do only one fonction for bootstrap that could be called with on the output of fitdist or fitdistcens

18. Decide if it is possible and desirable to gather fitdist and fitdistcens
   for the moment we think it is not easy and not desirable (see point 25)

=== "recently" done or not planned for argumented reasons ===

1. Remove calls to options(digits) in the code
    done everywhere                                     

2. Change print.fitdist and print.fitdistcens in order to give an output ressembling to the one of fitdistr
    not planned because I prefer to use a more common presentation of parameters (one per row) with standard
    error in the same row, as in a lm summary for example. But I have added the standard error ofr mle estimations

4. Remove echo in mledist before submission to CRAN 
   done

5. Change fitdistcens and mledistcens in the same way as fitdist and mledist 
   done by gathering mledist and mledistcens
   and adding new examples with optim.function or custom function for censored data)

6. Split summary.fitdist and print.summary.fitdist which is too long in two parts : 
   summary and gof (for goodness-of-fit results)
   done with a new function named "gofstat" instead of gof because there is a package
   named gof.
   
8. Try not to cut the density plot
   done

10. Add an argument in descdist not to plot the Cullen and Frey graph as in boxplot
    done, an argument "graph" added

14. Add a part on how to change le algorithm used to maximize the likelihood in the vignette
    done

16. Examine how it is possible to replace plotdist by plot.fitdist 
(not so simple as plotdist was written also to plot an observed distribution,
but it could be be splitted in two parts)

9. Draw the observed point in color in descdist
    done, two arguments were added in descdist : "obs.col" and "boot.col"

7. Change plotdist to use plot(ecdf...)
    instead of that, I have slightly modified the writing of plotdist in order to 
    facilitate the personalization of plots using the argument "..." because we sometimes prefer
    to see only the observed values on the CDF plot, or a linear interpolation than a step function.
    
23. Make it possible, as in fitdistr, to fix some arguments of a density function while
    estimating the other ones. Not so easy to rapidly implement as it must be repercuted
    on all the functions that use the result of a fit.
    
13. Check the values in the data set for censored data to reject a left value greater than a right value
    
22. Add the example published in Busschaert 2010 in the vignette and 
    in the examples, maybe with the data set in the package (censored microbiological data)
    

20. Improve moment matching estimation with numerical optimization

21. Start quantile matching estimation

27. Add Cramer von Mises distance in gofstat, defining three functions CvM, AD and KS and add
    gofedist for goodness-of-fit estimation by minimising that three same functions
    
28. Start maximum goodness-of-fit estimation

29. allow the possibility to change the moment order in mmedist.

31. ... dots argument seem not to work for plotdistcens. Bug fixed, but not easy to use. It is better
to use the new function cdfcompcens to personalize such a graph.
